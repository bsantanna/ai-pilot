# AI-Pilot

AI-Pilot: autonomous pilot research using computer vision and deep learning. 
Goal of this personal project is creating decision tree models for autonomous driving using different input datasets and
popular machine learning frameworks.

This is a work in progress...

## Feature Producing
In combination with features available in input datasets, this project also generates own set of features.

* [Lane detection](notebooks/computer_vision/lane_detection/README.md)
* Object detection (Work in progress, intending to use YOLOv3 with a public trained model in first moment to generate features.)
